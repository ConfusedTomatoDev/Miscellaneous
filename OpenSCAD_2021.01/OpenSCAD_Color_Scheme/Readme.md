# OpenSCAD Color Scheme creator.
Here is a Apache OpenOffice Spreadsheet that will take a set of cells you have set the fill color for and create the OpenSCAD 2021.01 JSON file for the viewer schemes using a macro.  

The document is a work in progress, currently only supports OpenSCAD viewer color schemes.  Future versions will also support the OpenSCAD editor color schemes.  

Checkout the folders and feel free to use what you find!
